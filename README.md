MECHANICS
The core mechanic of the game is transforming between different animal spirits to use their different abilities. The bunny and the monkey allow for double jumping and wall jumping respectively and act as your main platforming tools. Many complex levels utilize precice switching between these two to navigate the levels. The ox does not offer the same movement options, but allows you to push blocks which contribute to the puzzling aspect of the game along with allowing the other two spirits to reach new height or move past obstacles.

DYNAMIC
A key dynamic in our game is how each player’s gameplay may differ depending on which animal they wish to play as to beat each puzzle and progress. With the platforming often being very challenging, we knew dying in the game would be very common, but we didn’t want to make it feel too punishing to maintain the eternal theme. To compensate for this, respawning is really quick and death includes a particle effect to show the spirit returning to its starting position. The entirety of each level is captured by the entire screen so you don’t lose too much progress when you die and can get right back at another attempt. 

AESTHETICS
Our main connection with the eternal theme is the aesthetics of the game. The core story of the game is all about mystical spirits. The art and music both contribute to a very mystical and spiritual environment.  The music is a very calm and melodic tune that loops in different tones while the player progresses through the game based on the level that the player is on. This was meant to give the player the experience of playing with a soundtrack that follows them along their journey providing a perpetually similar yet fitting ambiance depending on where the player is in the game. Along with sound, the art displays eternal through colors. The spirit has a huge contrast compared to its environment where the background presents life and death through its dark and dim colors while the spirit is represented as an eternal object for its constant brightness, ability to give light in each level, and looking unaffected by the pollution around itself. With the fluid and instant respawn that happens when the player dies, it gives the player an immediate chance to try the level again which also contributes to the eternal theme of the game.
